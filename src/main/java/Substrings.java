public class Substrings {
    ////Task
    ////        Given a string, s, we define a substring, s', of s to be a string that occurs in s (i.e., a string matching some contiguous block of characters in s).
    ////
    ////        Complete the count_binary_substrings function. It has one parameter: a string, s, consisting of only 0s and 1s. The function must return an integer denoting the total number of substrings of s satisfying both of the following two conditions:
    ////
    ////        The 0s and 1s are grouped consecutively (e.g., 01, 10,0011, 1100, 000111, etc.).
    ////        The number of 0s in the substring is equal to the number of 1s in the substring
    ////        Specification
    ////        Challenge.countBinarySubstrings(s)
    ////        Parameters
    ////        s: String - a string consisting of only 0s and 1s.
    ////
    ////        Return Value
    ////        Integer - denoting the total number of substrings of s satisfying the conditions.
    ////
    ////        Constraints
    ////        5 ≤ s.length ≤ 5 × 100
    ////        String s consists of 0s and 1s only
    ////        Examples
    ////        s	Return Value
    ////        Example 1	"00110"	3
    ////        Example 2	"10101"	4
    ////        Example 3	"10001"	2
    ////        Explanation for example 1 ("00110")
    ////        There are three substrings having equal numbers of consecutively grouped 0s and 1s:
    ////
    ////        "0011", which is a substring of the characters from s0 to s3 (inclusive).
    ////        "01", which is a substring of the characters from s1 to s2 (inclusive).
    ////        "10", which is a substring of the characters from s3 to s4 (inclusive).
    ////        Thus, we return 3 as our answer.
    ////
    ////        Explanation for example 2 ("10101")
    ////        There are four substrings having equal numbers of consecutively grouped 0s and 1s:
    ////
    ////        "10", which is a substring of the characters from s0 to s1 (inclusive).
    ////        "01", which is a substring of the characters from s1 to s2 (inclusive).
    ////        "10", which is a substring of the characters from s2 to s3 (inclusive).
    ////        "01", which is a substring of the characters from s3 to s4 (inclusive).
    ////        Thus, we return 4 as our answer.
    ////
    ////        Explanation for example 3 ("10001")
    ////        There are two substrings having equal numbers of consecutively grouped 0s and 1s:
    ////
    ////        "10", which is a substring of the characters from s0 to s1 (inclusive).
    ////        "01", which is a substring of the characters from s3 to s4 (inclusive).
    ////        Thus, we return 2 as our answer.
